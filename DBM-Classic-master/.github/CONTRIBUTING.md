## Contributing

Welcome to DeadlyBossMods, it's great to have you here! We thank you in advance for
your contributions.

### I want to report a bug

- Look at the [open and closed
  issues](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if
  this was not already discussed before. If you can't see any, feel free to
  [open a new issue](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/issues/new).

### I want to contribute to the code

- Make sure to discuss your ideas with the community in an
  [issue](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/issues) or on the Discord.
- Take a look at the open issues labeled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/labels/help%20wanted)
  if you want to help without having a specific idea in mind.
- Make sure that your PRs do not contain unnecessary commits or merge commits.
  [Squash commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
  whenever possible.
- [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) (instead of
  merge) outdated PRs on the `master` branch.
