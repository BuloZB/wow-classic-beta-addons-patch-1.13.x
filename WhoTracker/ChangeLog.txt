ChangeLog

2.1.4 May 26th 2019
	- Fix for wow classic (hopefully, despite no beta access to test... help needed!)
	- LUA reformat, removing unecessary ; etc
	- use new C_FriendList.* who APIs
	- interact fine when LibWho-2.0 is installed: don't pop up the Who window (unless it's up)
	- Better structure of the whoTrackerSaved saved variable. If you wrote code to parse it, it will need change!
	- /wt debug on persists through reload/restart (/wt debug off to turn off) - also turns on WhoLib debug if it is present.
