# WeaponSwingTimerAddon
WeaponSwingTimer is an addon for WoW Classic that tracks your's and your target's swing timers. It resets on abilities that would reset a swing timer, such as Warrior's Slam, and also takes parry haste into account. Both frames can be moved around with the typical click-and-drag. A configuration window can be brought up with /wst /WeaponSwingTimer or /weaponswingtimer where more visual options are available.

## Crit Reactive Procs (CRPs) Update For V3.0
A recent video by Esfand (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9kWkI4F-I) showed that Crit Reactive Procs can be triggered if correctly timed. 

I felt like my old update (v2.0) spread misinformation about when to stand up for CRPs to trigger. I studied the video further and it seems like as long as the player stands up when the the target's swing timer resets (i.e. when the bar empties and starts filling up) a CRP will trigger. 

**Ideally the player would stand up when the target's swing timer resets, causing the CRPs to trigger.**
