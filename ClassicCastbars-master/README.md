## ClassicCastbars
Lightweight addon that adds castingbars to the target frame and nameplates in Classic World of Warcraft 1.13.x.  
Castbars have configurable size, positioning and more. See /castbars.

## Install (--- IMPORTANT ---)
- When installing from Github, you need to unzip & extract `ClassicCastbars-master/ClassicCastbars` and `ClassicCastbars-master/ClassicCastbars_Options` into your AddOns folder, as two seperate    folders. (They're essentially two different addons)
  **Do not put the root `ClassicCastbars-master` folder into your AddOns directory.**
- You can also download a packaged version from WoWInterface [here.](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info24925-ClassicCastbars.html)

## Configuration
Type `/castbar` or go to `Escape -> Interface Options -> AddOns -> ClassicCastbars` to open the options panel.  
Feel free to request new options, however, I want this addon to remain as lightweight and blizz-like as possible so I won't
add any major things like retexturing frames, custom animations, alerts and so on.

    When forking the addon you should save the folder somewhere outside your WoW AddOns directory and  
    instead have two symlinks inside the AddOns folder pointing to
    `forkFolder/ClassicCastbars/` and `forkFolder/ClassicCastbars_Options/`.
