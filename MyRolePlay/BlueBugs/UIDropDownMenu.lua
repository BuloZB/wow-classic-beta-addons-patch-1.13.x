	UIDropDownMenu_Refresh() taint

	This fixes one of the most infamous taint issues in WoW. This taint usually
	manifests as UIDROPDOWNMENU_MENU_LEVEL taint, but the root cause is insecure
	variables being left in the dropdown buttons. These insecure variables can
	be read when UIDropDownMenu_Refresh() is called.

	Specifically, when iterating through the buttons of a dropdown, the refresh
	function compares the value key with the selected value of the menu being
	refreshed... And the value key, if the new menu doesn't use values or
	doesn't have as many buttons as the previous menu, then taints the
	execution. Since this isn't wrapped in securecall() anywhere, it spreads
	taint horridly -- specifically, the next global variable to usually get
	tainted is UIDROPDOWNMENU_MENU_LEVEL.

	This taint is fixed by, while a menu is being initialized, clearing out any
	insecure keys leftover from previous menus.

	Possible fix locations:
	Interface\FrameXML\UIDropDownMenu.lua:35-59
	Interface\FrameXML\UIDropDownMenu.lua:608-623

	The communites frame is a special case, as it doesn't bother initializing
	even a single menu before starting to muck around with them, so the
	absolutely hideous workaround is to show and hide a frame that will
	initialize a secure menu in OnShow. The AddonList is a very good target, as
	it also prevents the community frame from opening if it's open.
