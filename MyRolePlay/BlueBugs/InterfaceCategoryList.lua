	InterfaceCategoryList_Update() taint

	The selection key is often tainted, if an addon options panel is selected.
	This taints the execution path of InterfaceCategoryList_Update(), and will
	often spread to other things (most commonly, raid profiles).

	Possible fix locations:
	Interface\FrameXML\InterfaceOptionsFrame.lua:83-135
